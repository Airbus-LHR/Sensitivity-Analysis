# UAV Flight Range Sensitivity Analysis
This project is the accompanying code repository for the Edexcel EPQ research project, "Investigating the Relationship Between Drone Cruise Speed and Maximum Flight Range" It implements the following core functionalities:

- Flight range mathematical model based on the law of conservation of energy.
- Single-variable (payload/efficiency/Cd coefficient) sensitivity analysis.
- Two-variable (payload-speed) heatmap visualization.
- Experimental data vs. theoretical value comparison and verification.


## Quick Start

### Set up Environment

# 2. install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. install python libraries
pip install matplotlib
sudo pip install seaborn
pip install pandas
pip install numpy

# 4. download the python code and run
