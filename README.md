# UAV Flight Range Sensitivity Analysis
This project is the accompanying code repository for the Edexcel EPQ research project, "Investigating the Relationship Between Drone Cruise Speed and Maximum Flight Range." It implements the following core functionalities:

- Flight range mathematical model based on the law of conservation of energy.
- Single-variable (payload/efficiency/Cd coefficient) sensitivity analysis.
- Two-variable (payload-speed) heatmap visualization.
- Experimental data vs. theoretical value comparison and verification.
